# UDIT
Machine Learning project comparing 5 algorithms to predict student performance.
# Student Performance Prediction
Machine Learning project using 5 algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes)
to predict whether a student will pass or fail.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
- Random Forest: Best accuracy (~90%)
- Decision Tree: Slightly overfitted
- KNN: Moderate
- Logistic Regression: Lower
- Naive Bayes: Lowest
